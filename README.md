# CS537-Projects
All programs in this repository were written by me, Michael Goldstein, for my CS 537 course at UW-Madison during the Spring 2021 semester.
Programs 2, 4, 5, and 6 were completed from xv6 source code provided by the course instructors. Programs 4 through 7 were done with program partner Roma Kashpar.
Note: For each program, the final working version of each C file or folder is the file or folder without any parenthesis in its name.
Files or folders with parenthesis are past versions, and the comments in parenthesis explain their state and issues.
